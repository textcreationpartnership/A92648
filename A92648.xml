         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156986:3"/>although no Religion, but to define them more punctually, they are neither Sect or Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledge no God, but I deſire not to bee prolixious in circumſtance, but will treat of that which moſt concerns me; There was a proud Arminian which lately hangd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by name called <hi>Iohn Hobſon,</hi> once a Student of the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge.</p>
            <p>A long time was hee a perfect Proteſtant in being ruled by the Reall Scriptures Alphabet, not wreſting it to his own ends or purpoſe, But he perceiving the times to be altered he would needs exerciſe the changes, and bee a dancer in the figure, his ſole ambition was to make his bad opinion good by antiquity, but at laſt his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities deceived him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> growing to a Reformation, he had ſo farre ſtudied in that diabolicall practice, that maugre all pietie, he would ſtil perſiſt in his own opinion, although it were as vaine as his own Carriage, which was none of the beſt, as I ſhall inſtantly declare unto the gentle Reader, which being done, judge the man by his workes.</p>
            <p>This man lived in <hi>Norfolke</hi> nigh unto <hi>Lyn,</hi> where he had meanes good ſtore, as was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Kinfolks and neighbours there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to the value of two hundred poundes <hi>per annum,</hi> beſides he was one of the Prebends of <hi>Ely,</hi> what that came to it is better knowne to D. <hi>Wren,</hi> if without offence I may ſo tearme him, then to my ſelf, Doctor <hi>Cozens</hi> was always his intimate friend, <hi>Nicholls,</hi> for the title of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156986:3"/>Gentleman I will not beſtow upon him, by the reaſon in the Maſters Lodge of Trinity Colledg in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> hee did hold argument, that the Pope of <hi>Romes</hi> prerogative in eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Civill was more then our King could claim to his prerogative, D. <hi>Cozens</hi> at that time was Vice-chancelor, and at that time did ſup with D. <hi>Cumber,</hi> before named, (a man not guilty of temporizing faction) he being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany withſtood his argument, which Dr. <hi>Cozens</hi> perceiving, could doe no otherwiſe for his owne ſafety, but commit him to ſafe cuſtody, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in a ſmall ſpace he was delivered, Juſtice being not proſecuted againſt him, by whoſe power, judicious Reader thou maiſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, I doe not feare to ſay, it was by Doct. <hi>Cozens</hi> command that arch Arminian, whoſe Chappell inſteed of ſound Doctrine, is adorned with Romiſh Superſtitions, Croſſes, <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> theſe he more delighted in, then to preach in the Vniverſity Church of S. <hi>Mary's,</hi> but to come to the purpoſe, this <hi>Nicholls</hi> was an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend of this <hi>Iohn Hobſon,</hi> or rather damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foe, for ſince it hath apparently proved, hee was the blinder of him, and the cauſer of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall tenebroſity: This <hi>John Hobſon</hi> was ſo much by his allurements brought aſtray, that at length with perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> he was not fearfull to hold the garments of thoſe which ſhould ſtone godly <hi>Stephen,</hi> true hearted, religious, and pious affected Proteſtants I meane, the Biſhop of <hi>Camerbury,</hi> he honoured as a God upon earth, and accounted his Doctrine to bee as pure as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156986:4"/>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> was after his converſion, which me thinks hee ſhould not, <hi>Paul</hi> being a paines taking man to convert the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the other ſuch a one who deſired nothing more but to convert the truth. But I conclude in ſpeaking of him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Tower locks are ſtrong enough to bar him, from corrupting any more Cathedralls by making them Altarwiſe. Occaſions ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly have met me, that as yet I have not writ ſcarce any thing to my theame, but now I ſhall begin to bee more ſeriouſly intended.</p>
            <p>This <hi>John Hobſon</hi> long time was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of thoſe which were zealouſly affected, if bowing would argue a man not to be proud, I might truly affirme him to be humble, but the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſent lately made a diſtinction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt upon force hold the negative part, at length this Dotard, (for I can give him no better Title) the times being altered, hee began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own perverſneſſe, and being left to him, was perſwaded no remiſſion could be afforded, his offences were ſo hainous, that hee choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die in deſpaire with <hi>Judas,</hi> then at the Cocks crowing, (the ſigne of the moſt happy Reformation, by this wiſe Parliament) to repent with <hi>Peter,</hi> wherefore moſt miſerably contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating within himſelfe, it was probably affirmed by his Wife which over-heard him, that he not long before his death ſpake theſe words.</p>
            <p>Long time againſt my conſcience, have I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and diſputed againſt my knowledge, and have with-holden them which were of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156986:4"/>opinion like to my ſelf, and now I perceive the mutabilitie of times is at hand, Articles will be preferr'd againſt mee, and then to be hang'd ſhall I be ſure for ſeducing of the Kings Liege people, to die at the Gallowes will be a very great ſhame unto mee, wherefore I will rather chuſe to die with <hi>Judas,</hi> then to be hang'd with <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes, which words being ſpoken, hee went haſtily out of his ſtudie, and told his wife he was going to walke, becauſe hee intended to preach on Sunday, notwithſtanding ſhee feared the worſt, and would not have ſuffered him, hee ſmiled at her, and deſired her to let him goe, ſhee thinking (notwithſtanding his former words) he was going to ſtudie, ſhe ſuffered him.</p>
            <p>He feigned as if he had been going to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but went a contrary way to his Barne, ſo ſoon as he came, as it was conjectured, he plucked out of his pocket theſe Verſes,</p>
